First combine macaroni, 4 cups water and 1 tablespoon salt in a 6- or 8-quart Instant Pot multi-cooker. Lock the lid and set pressure cook on high for 4 minutes. After the pressure cook cycle is complete, unlock and remove the lid and switch to the low saute setting. Stir in evaporated milk, butter and 1/4 cup water. Then add the Cheddar, a little at a time, while constantly stirring, until the cheese is completely melted. Serve hot.
